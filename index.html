    The domestication of the dog was the process which led to the domestic dog.
     This included the dog's genetic divergence from the wolf, its domestication, and the emergence of the first dogs.
     Genetic studies suggest that all ancient and modern dogs share a common ancestry and descended from an ancient, now-extinct wolf population – or closely related wolf populations – which was distinct from the modern wolf lineage.
      The dog's similarity to the grey wolf is the result of substantial dog-into-wolf gene flow, with the modern grey wolf being the dog's nearest living relative.
       An extinct Late Pleistocene wolf may have been the ancestor of the dog.
